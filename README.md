Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bitbucket

## Usage

**WARNING** These specs will be changed at any time.

NOTE: `x` mark means `Already implemented.`.

### Configure

```ruby
logger = Logger.new($stdout)
logger.level = Logger::WARN

Tinybucket.configure do |config|
  # Configure logger if you want.
  #
  # optional, default: nil (no logging)
  config.logger = logger

  # Configure cache_store options if you need.
  #
  # see https://github.com/plataformatec/faraday-http-cache
  #
  # optional, default: nil (disable request cache)
  config.cache_store_options = { store: Rails.cache, logger: logger }

  # Configure oauth_token/oauth_secret
  config.oauth_token = 'key'
  config.oauth_secret = 'secret'
end
```

### Pagination

After v1.0.0, tinybucket gem support [lazy enumerator](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Enumerator/Lazy.html) !

This feature make your code more rubyish, like this.

```ruby
# get enumerator to enumerate repositories.
repos = bucket.repos('myname')

# Select repositories which has 2 pull requests to be reviewed.
repos = repos('my_name').select do |repo|
  repo.pull_requests.size > 2
end.map(&:full_name)
```

This enumerable feature depends on [Paging through object collections](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/pagination) at Bitbucket Cloud REST API.

#### NOTE: About `size` attribute

[object collections wrapper](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/pagination) has `size` attribute at Bitbucket Cloud REST API.

The `size` attribute describe as `optional` attribute.

In tinybucket gem, collection size depend on `side` attribute of [object collections wrapper](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/pagination) in Bitbucket Cloud REST API.

So enumerator's `size` attribute may return `nil`.
